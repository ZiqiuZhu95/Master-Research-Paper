# Master-Research-Paper
A repository dedicated to making my master's research paper publicly available.

In my final semester of my Master's program at Wilfrid Laurier University, I undertook Economics 681 with the goal of applying my economic knowledge to an issue of interest and produce a concise written report of empirical economic research and polished verbal presentation of the analysis. Particularly, I chose to study the empirical macroeconomic effects of supply and demand, the effects that initiated most journeys into the field of economics. This is because the demand and supply effects on the most widely traded commodity in the world, is crude oil and its derivatives.

In the following paper, I was assessed on my ability to crically assess current economic literature related to the research question and their key findings, interpret economic data through descriptive statistics and graphs and conveying arguments convincingly through all technical components of the report. Most importantly, the submission must be written for an audience that has an undergraduate degree in economics without any knowledge of my topic.
