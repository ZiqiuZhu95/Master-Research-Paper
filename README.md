A repository dedicated to making my master's research paper publicly available.

In my final semester of my Master's program at Wilfrid Laurier University, I undertook Economics 681 with the goal of applying my economic knowledge to an issue of interest and producing a concise written report of empirical economic research that is complemented with a verbal presentation of the analysis. Particularly, I chose to study the empirical macroeconomic effects of supply and demand on crude oil, the most widely traded commodity par excellence, to dissect the determinants of price movements through the lens of demand and supply shocks.

In the following paper, I was assessed on my ability to critically assess current economic literature related to the research question and their key findings, interpret economic data through descriptive statistics and graphs, and convey arguments convincingly through all technical components of the report. Most importantly, the submission was assessed for its interpretability for an audience that lacked any specialization in the topic.
